# The EU's non-state Regional and Minority Languages
This map viz was a lot of fun to work on as I love making data digestible and useful with maps. Here's the map of non-state regional and minority languages in the EU, covered by the CoE's European Charter for Regional and Minority Languages! [My dashboard](https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/sencereu/viz/EUMinorityLanguages/Dashboard1) was inspired by the ELDIA project's [similar RMLs map](https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/horizon3069/viz/TheEUsregionalandminoritylanguages_0/Dashboard1) and the EU's 203 national minority/linguistic groups, one of which I am a part of.

ðŸ‡ªðŸ‡º The European linguistic diversity goes far beyond the EU's 24 official languages. In the Union, 40 to 50 million people speak one of its 60 regional and minority languages, some of which are at serious risk. Minority languages account for linguistic diversity and belong to humanity's intangible cultural heritage. Their protection and promotion contribute to the building of a Europe based on democracy and cultural diversity.

ðŸ”” Non-state RMLs, as defined by the Charter, are languages traditionally used within a given territory of a state by nationals of that state who form a group numerically smaller than the rest of the stateâ€™s population; they are different from the official language(s) in any of the countries, and they include neither dialects of the official language(s) in any of the countries nor the languages of migrants.
